# Mixing It Up With Elixir
##


## Level 1
- Functions are first class citizens
- Which means:
	1. Functins can be assigne to varibales
	2. Functions can be passed around to other arguments.
- *Anonymous Functions* have no name and no module.
- These are declared using `fn -> ....    end`.
- `fn( .., .., ..)` is how you pass variables to the anonymous function
- To call an anonymous function, you use `func_name.(.., .., ..)`
