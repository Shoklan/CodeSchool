# Keeping it Classy with C#

# Methods
- All projects have a *.csproj* file, which I missed from the last class.
- To create a method, we're going to need a *name* as well as *parameters* for it.
- Method names should use **Pascal Case**.
- *Parameters* should be prefixed with the data type.
- Methods also require a *return type* and a *Return Statement*.
- To call a method, we use its name along with the necessary parameters.
```

```
- Methods that do not return anything should use the **void** return data type.
