# Keeping it Classy with C#

# Methods
- All projects have a *.csproj* file, which I missed from the last class.
- To create a method, we're going to need a *name* as well as *parameters* for it.
- Method names should use **Pascal Case**.
- *Parameters* should be prefixed with the data type.
- Methods also require a *return type* and a *Return Statement*.
- To call a method, we use its name along with the necessary parameters.
```
string announcement = AnnounceBand("The C Sharp");
```
- Methods that do not return anything should use the **void** return data type.

# Classes
- The **Class** defines the structure of the object.
- While the **Object** is the instance of the class.
- To declare a class we use the format `class <class_name> `.
- It's standard nomenclature to call the file what we're going to call the class inside it.
- The variables declared inside a class are called **Instance Variables**.
- Each individual object, or instance, has its own *instance variables*.
- **Namespaces** are used to organize classes to allow for reuse.
- *Namespaces* can be accessed using the format `Namespace.Class.Method`.
- You can shorten this using what is called a **Directive**.
```
using System;
// using System.Console
```
- You can create a new instance using the format `new <Class>()`.
```
<Class> <instance_name> = new <Class_name>()
```
- **Protection Levels** are set by what are known as *Access Modifiers*.
- The *public accessor* allows the variable to be accessible anywhere.
- The *private accessor* allows the variable to be accessible only in the class.
- The default mode is private.
