# What is C#?
- .. is a general purpose object-oriented programming language released by Microsoft in 2002.
- Characteristics:
  * Compiled.
  * Strongly Typed.
  * .Net language; allows us to mix C#, F#, VB.Net
- Create a new program using `dotnet new console`.
- All modern C# programs will start in the *Program.cs* file.
- **Classes** allow us to separate our code into objects.
- **Methods** contain the executable code.
- Execution will start at the *Main function*.
- `Console.WriteLine()` will print what we pass to the console.
- Before running program, use `dotnet restore` to manage dependencies.
- This needs to be run before our first run as well as when dependencies change.
- You can run the program using `dotnet run`
- To read input, you use `Console.readLine()`.

# Variable
- **Variables** allow us to store information in memory for use later.
- To use a variable, you need to declare it.
- The declaration requires the *datatype* of the variable and then the *name* of it.
- **=** is the *assignment operator* as per normal.
- There are *15* different built in data types.
- We can convert a string to an integer use the `int.Parse()` method.
